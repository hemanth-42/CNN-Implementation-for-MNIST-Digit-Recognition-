Introduction
This code implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for optical recognition of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 8x8 pixels. The goal is to train a CNN to accurately classify these digits. The code involves data preprocessing, defining the CNN architecture, training the model, evaluating its performance, and conducting analysis including K-Fold Cross Validation and Confusion Matrix analysis.

CNN implementation Analysis
The implementation of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) involves several key components, each contributing to the overall architecture and functionality of the model. Here's a detailed explanation of each component:

1.	Convolutional Layers:
•	Documentation: Convolutional layers are fundamental building blocks of CNNs that apply a set of learnable filters to the input data, extracting local patterns or features.
•	Analysis: In this implementation, three convolutional layers are used. Each layer consists of 2D convolution operations with 32, 64, and 64 filters respectively, each having a 3x3 kernel size. ReLU activation functions are applied to introduce non-linearity, and 'same' padding is used to preserve the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
2.	Max Pooling Layers:
•	Documentation: Max pooling layers downsample the feature maps obtained from the convolutional layers by selecting the maximum value within a fixed window.
•	Analysis: After each convolutional layer, a max pooling layer with a 2x2 window size is applied. Max pooling helps in reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while retaining the most important information, thereby reducing computational complexity and controlling overfitting.
3.	Flattening Layer:
•	Documentation: The flattening layer transforms the multi-dimensional feature maps into a one-dimensional vector, ready to be fed into the fully connected layers for classification.
•	Analysis: After the last convolutional layer, a flattening layer is added to reshape the 3D feature maps into a 1D vector. This allows the subsequent fully connected layers to perform classification based on the extracted features.
4.	Fully Connected Layers:
•	Documentation: Fully connected layers are traditional neural network layers where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous and next layers.
•	Analysis: Two fully connected layers are included in the model architecture. The first fully connected layer consists of 64 neurons with ReLU activation, while the final layer has 10 neurons corresponding to the number of classes in the dataset, with softmax activation for classification.
5.	Model Compilation and Training:
•	Documentation: Compilation involves configuring the model for training by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. Training involves feeding the training data to the model and adjusting the model parameters (weights and biases) based on the optimization algorithm to minimize the loss function.
•	Analysis: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. It is trained on the training dataset for three epochs with a batch size of 64. The training progress is monitored using the training and validation accuracy metrics.
6.	Evaluation:
•	Documentation: Evaluation assesses the performance of the trained model on unseen data (test dataset) to measure its accuracy and generalization ability.
•	Analysis: The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset, and the test accuracy is computed to quantify the model's performance in classifying handwritten digits.
